        Well, we've got answers. What is a domain name? Think of your domain
        name as a street address for your website. Without a domain name, you'd
        have to tell customers to visit your site at an IP-based url, such as
        123.123.123.123/~yourwebsite, instead of yourwebsite.com. Not very
        memorable, eh? To be successful on the interwebs, you'll want to invest
        in a domain name to ensure your site has a level of professionalism,
        appropriate branding, and overall awesomeness.

        What's the difference between buying a domain and a hosting package? As
        said above, a domain name is like your website's street address, whereas
        web hosting is like your website's actual home — where all the files,
        images, and other info actually lives. Your site needs both an address
        and a home to be up and running, but they are definitely two different
        things. Learn more about the difference between domains and hosting.

        How do I buy a website domain name? Buying a domain name begins with our
        domain name search tool at the top of this page. Once you find an
        available domain name, you can purchase it, register it, and ensure it's
        pointed to your hosting account. Here's what to do after you've
        purchased your domain name.

        Is Domain Name Privacy Protection worth it? To put it simply: yes, yes,
        and yes. To put it a little less simply: When your domain is registered,
        you're required to maintain a publicly viewable WHOIS database that
        displays all your contact details — including home address and phone
        number. This puts you at risk of spam and identity theft (yikes).
        Luckily, you can keep your info hidden from the public eye by opting to
        use Domain Privacy Protection. Interested parties will still be able to
        contact you if they so please, but your identity will remain anonymous —
        aka super top secret. Learn more about Domain Name Privacy.
